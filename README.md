# Physics 180E IDL Library Files

These are IDL library files that were made available to students of the UCLA Physics 180E Plasma Physics Laboratory course that was taught by Walter Gekelman and ran until the end of 2019.

Files beginning with 'h5' are helper functions required for 'readhdf5.pro' to run.
